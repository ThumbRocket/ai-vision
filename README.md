# Summary
This repository is vison model reference to make jupyter NoteBook

# Classfication
### CNN_Classification.ipynb
In this notebook, we will delve into advanced image classification techniques using PyTorch. We will cover four essential chapters, each focusing on a critical aspect of building, training, and utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification tasks.
### Vison_Transfomer.ipynb
This notebook provides the simple walkthrough of the Vision Transformer. We hope you will be able to understand how it works by looking at the actual data flow during inference.
### Swin_Transformer.ipynb
Swin Transformer is a hirarchical vision transformer that was published in 2021 and selected as the best paper at ICCV 2021. In this post, we'll go over the fundamental concepts of Swin Transformer without the full explanation of implementation details (Although some provided).

# Segmentation
### Segmentation_FCN.ipynb
In this Notebook, we will perform Image Segmentation using Fully Convolutional Network on PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset which contains 20 object categories. We use the Semantic Boundaries Dataset (SBD) as it contains more segmentation labels than the original dataset.
